S-timator: dynamical systems modelling in python
================================================

``S-timator`` is a Python library to analyse **ODE-based models**
(also known as *dynamic* or *kinetic* models). These models are often found
in many scientific fields, particularly in Physics, Chemistry, Biology and
Engineering.

For a brief introduction to the package, you can read the :ref:`introductory notes <introduction>`.

Much more detail can be found in the S-timator :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`.

You can also browse the :ref:`example gallery <example_gallery>` or :ref:`API reference <api_ref>` to see the kind of tools that are available.
