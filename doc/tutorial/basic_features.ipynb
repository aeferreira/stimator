      "\n",
      "Depending on the field, **processes** can be a chemical reaction, the flow of charge in a node of an electrical network, predation in an ecological system, the inflow of potassium into neuron, etc; anything related to transport or transformation. Examples of **variables** are the concentrations of chemical species, the number of individuals in the population of prey, the charge of a capacitor, the ammount of mRNA transcribed from a gene, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "**A key demand in the formulation of a kinetic model is that the rate of any processes is known or can be assigned in advance**. These rates, usually depend on the concentrations of variables and, in turn, the concentrations of the variables that are connected by a certain process are influenced by the rate of that process.\n",
      "\n",
      "But modelling is not about the study of the kinetic of the individual processes. Instead, the primary objective is to predict or make inferences about the **dynamics of the system as a whole**, in particular to predict the change in the concentrations of the variables considered in the model."
